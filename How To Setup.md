## Step 1 - Make the folder and create the Terminal profile.
Make a folder on your desktop called whatever you want (e.g., Google Gemini Terminal) and create a `.py` file in that folder called whatever you want (e.g., geminiterminal). Afterwards, right click on the `.py` file and click `Copy as path`, you'll need it for later.

Open Terminal by pressing `Win+X` and clicking Terminal:

After that, press `Ctrl+,` and click `+ Add a new profile` on the sidebar, then click `+ New Empty Profile`.
Name it anything you want, preferably `Google Gemini`.

Click on the `Command Line` dropdown. In here, type `py "C:\paste\your\path\here.py"` (replace that path with your copied one).
Click on `Starting Directory` and preferably put `C:\Users\[YourUser]\Desktop` (replace [YourUser] with your user, it should be visible [EDIT HERE]
