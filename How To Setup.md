## Step 1 - Make the folder and create the Terminal profile.
Make a folder on your desktop called whatever you want (e.g., Google Gemini Terminal) and create a `.py` file in that folder called whatever you want (e.g., geminiterminal). Afterwards, right click on the `.py` file and click `Copy as path`, you'll need it for later.

Open Terminal by pressing `Win+X` and clicking Terminal:

After that, press `Ctrl+,` and click `+ Add a new profile` on the sidebar, then click `+ New Empty Profile`.
Name it anything you want, preferably `Google Gemini`.

Click on the `Command Line` dropdown. In here, type `py "C:\paste\your\path\here.py"` (replace that path with your copied one).
Click on `Starting Directory` and put `C:\Users\[YourUser]\Desktop`, replace [YourUser] with your user, it should be visible in the terminal (non admin) when you open Windows PowerShell.
[OPTIONAL] Make a tab title and put anything you want.

## Step 3 - Customize it!
Click Appearance at the bottom of your profile settings, and choose your font weight (boldness), Color Scheme, etc.
You can also make your own Color Scheme in the Color Scheme section in the terminal settings (if you aren't in the terminal settings already, press `Win+X` and click terminal, then press `Ctrl+,`)
